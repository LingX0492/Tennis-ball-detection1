# Tennis Ball Detection with YOLOv5

This repository contains a YOLOv5 model specifically trained for tennis ball detection. YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art object detection model that provides fast and accurate results.

## Features

- **High Accuracy**: Detects tennis balls with high precision.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Suitable for real-time applications.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt the model for other object detection tasks.

## Installation

To use this model, you'll need to have Python and several packages installed. Follow these instructions to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tennis-ball-detection.git
   cd tennis-ball-detection

## Usage
~Running the Model
To run the tennis ball detection model on an image or video, use the following command:
  python detect.py --source path/to/your/image_or_video --weights path/to/your/yolov5_model.pt --output path/to/save/results
--source: Path to the image or video file you want to process.
--weights: Path to the YOLOv5 model weights file.
--output: Directory where the results will be saved.
~Training Your Own Model
If you want to train the YOLOv5 model with your own dataset, follow these steps:
Prepare your dataset: Ensure that your dataset is in YOLO format.
Update the configuration files: Modify data.yaml and hyp.scratch.yaml as needed for your dataset.

Start training:
python train.py --img-size 640 --batch-size 16 --epochs 50 --data path/to/your/data.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --cache
--img-size: Image size for training.
--batch-size: Batch size for training.
--epochs: Number of epochs for training.
--data: Path to your dataset configuration file.
--weights: Path to the pre-trained weights file to start from.
